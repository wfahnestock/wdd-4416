## “Good Code Documents Itself” And Other Hilarious Jokes You Shouldn’t Tell Yourself
This article is about writing good comments and documentation for an application.

* Code should be written in such a way that it is meaningful even without documentation - someone should be able to just look at it and see what its function is.
* Regular comments should be used to explain what the code block it's near is doing or performing, and why it was written. Documentation comments are used to describe global variables, functions, and modules from an outside point of view.
* Comments and documentation should exist as part of an applications code, not something that gets written once and then left for all time. They should be updated as the application receives updates to maintain clear communication of what each piece of the puzzle does.

## Clean Code vs. Dirty Code: React Best Practices
This article is about how to ensure that you are writing clean code that is easy to read, maintain, and update.

* Clean code can be defined as a style of programming that makes code easier to write, read, and maintain.
* After solving a problem, fixing a bug, or adding a new feature, you have a chance to clean up the code by removing dead code, refactoring, or removing commented out code that wasn't used in the final feature or fix. This will make code easier to read and maintain in the long run.
* DRY - don't repeat yourself. If you are doing the same thing in multiple places in an application, consolidate the duplicate code.

## How to write a good README for your GitHub project?
This article describes how to write a good README for GitHub projects.

* A good README is for others looking at a repository to understand what the code in the repo includes, and why it's noteworthy.
* Not only is a good README for other people, it can be a helpful tool that aids in relaunching a project you worked on in the past without wasting time trying to recall "What was this project all about?".
* A README file should *always* include the following elements: Titles and internal titles, the introduction which is also the project's aim or focus, technologies used in the project, and how to launch the project.

# What resource(s) did you find most helpful for this research assignment and why? 

I found the article about writing good READMEs the most helpful. This article really helped me understand the importance of crafting a good README for my projects, and it helped me learn that a README is not only for other people looking at my projects but it can also be a useful tool that helps myself some time in the future if I decide to revisit a project that I have worked on the past. After reviewing this article, I can say that I will be spending more time focusing on the README in my projects and repositories to make sure that I am creating a README that is not only helpful to anyone outside looking in to my project but one that is also helpful to myself. I think this article is a must read for all newer developers so that they understand the importance of the README file and how it can benefit not only others such as recruiters or potential employers but also themselves.
