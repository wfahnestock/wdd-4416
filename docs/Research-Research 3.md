## Use Case and Use Case Testing Complete Tutorial
This article is about proper use case testing and how to conduct it for an application that you are designing.

* Use case is a tool defining the required user action. When trying to create a new application or make changes to an existing application, there are several discussions to be had about how you, as a developer, will represent the requirement for the software solution.
* In use case, you describe 'how a system wil respond to a given scenario', and if the system is user-oriented or system-oriented.

* Sunny day use cases - This is the primary use cases that are most likely to happen when everything work properly and goes well. These use cases are given higher priority than other use cases.
* Rainy day use cases - These use cases can be defined as a list of edge cases. The priority of these will come after the Sunny day use cases.

## Everything you need to know about Loading Animations
This article is about creating proper loading animations that convey appropriate feedback to the user of the application.

* Time estimation is important when designing loading animations. It can be as simple as a message of approximate time to wait or a visual representation of work done. Proper UX details can set expectations and reduce user frustration.
* Explain why the user needs to wait. It is not always obvious to the user why their application or tool is not reacting instantly. Smart loading animations can give a reason for the wait and explain what is happening behind the scenes.
* Reduce the user's perception of waiting time. If you can design an animation that grabs the user's attention while they are waiting for some action to complete, the mental time will pass faster. This can be stuff like a good color combination, interesting or cute idea, or some other attention getter.

## Designing for the good
This article describes how to design appropriate success states for an application.

* Making sure that the user of your application is informed when the product is working fine can improve the application's user experience.
* Creating a nice success state message or animation will make the end user feel satisfied after seeing a positive message for choosing your application to complete some task.
* Success state must provide clear information that the performed action was a success. Getting good content is as important as getting a good design for the success states.

# What resource(s) did you find most helpful for this research assignment and why? 

I found the article about creating good loading animations the most helpful. It really helped me see how creating inuitive and proper feedback loading animation are important in crafting a good user experience within an application. After reviewing this article, I can feel confident in my knowledge to craft helpful yet informative loading animations to convey to the user when something is happening in the background of an application so that they don't feel instantly frustrated when something is taking a long time or doesn't happen instantly for them.
